## About Me
 - I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Washington, Seattle. 
 - Although early in my career, I have broad interests in SWE, theory of computation, and machine learning.

## Experience and Teaching
 - I was a TA for the Fall CSE 190B seminar which facilitates learning objectives that help first-year CS students in their academic and professional journeys.
 - In the summer of 2024, I interned with the City of Seattle as a front-desk admin in their facilities management division. My job was to coordinate with various city tenants in maintaining public properties, which was done through the Oracle Primavera Unifier software.
 - In the summer of 2023, I was a part of the Amazon Career Quest program, where I worked in a group setting to solve an environmental problem that we recognized could be tackled by using Arduinos.

## Skills
 - _Programming Languages:_ Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, OCaml, Racket, Ruby, Python
 - _Frameworks:_ Proficient in React, Node.js/Express, Google Maps Javascript API, NumPy, Java Swing, Figma
 - _Programming Concepts:_ Object-Oriented programming, Functional programming, Full-Stack Architecture

## Projects
- **Sustainability in Greece:** Full-stack website built with React and TypeScript that showcases sustainable practices in Greece that I researched during my study abroad program. Through an interactive, map-driven experience, the site integrates the Google Maps JavaScript API to visualize locations and routes. The project was deployed to the cloud using Vercel and a Node/Express backend.
