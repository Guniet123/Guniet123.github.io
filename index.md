## About Me
 - I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Washington, Seattle. 

## Experience and Teaching
 - I was a TA for the Fall CSE 190B seminar which facilitates learning objectives that help first-year CS students in their academic and professional journeys.
 - In the summer of 2024, I interned with the City of Seattle as a front-desk admin in their facilities management division. My job was to coordinate with various city tenants in maintaining public properties, which was done through the Oracle Primavera Unifier software.
 - In the summer of 2023, I was a part of the Amazon Career Quest program, where I worked in a group setting to solve an environmental problem that we recognized could be tackled by using Arduinos.
